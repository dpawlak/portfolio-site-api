# Django REST framework and React app. 
Includes webpack, and babel. Currently broken after failed deployment. To fix, I will configure my staticfiles directory 
for deployment and run the build command on my React app to compile. Then, put the single compiled React app file into my static folder. In my templates directory there is an index page that will has a div with an id='app' and script tag that points to my compiled React app. 

This project is a code along from Brad Traversy on Youtube.
